## Bubble Sort works by swapping two at a time

[1, 4, 2, 3]
__compares__ 1, 4 : no swap needed
__compares__ 4, 2 : swap needed
[1, 2, 4, 3]
__compares__ 4, 3 : swap needed
[1, 2, 3, 4]

# Function Considerations

- Loop Method runs until entire array is sorted.
- Swaps if values are unsorted
